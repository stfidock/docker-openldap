# docker-openldap

Yast another docker for Openldap.
I wanted to have an up-to-date docker openldap container, therefore I created a fresh one.

## Ideas

I checked different containers, but something was missing, or not up-to-date

- [docker-slapd](https://github.com/nickstenning/docker-slapd)
- [osixia docker](https://github.com/osixia/docker-openldap)
